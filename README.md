Let me walk you through the pages (well not every page :smirk:)


## Login Page

As I said earlier we are privacy focussed, thus we only require username and password

## User Landing 

Recenty created communities show up at the timeline when you login. That's our way of uplifting communities. However if you are looking for any specific community then no worries we have the search facility as well.

## Domain Page

Your newly created page will comprise of all the posts made by you and other users. Here you can like any post, comment any post and... Well we are working on the share feature by building our own link shortener.

## Account Settings

We all have a habit of getting paranoid about our passwords. In a way that's good actually because that will force you to change it. So, this is the page that lets you do that and guess what we also have added TOTP 2FA for more security.
